# Founders Table Static Site

This is a static website for Founders Table built with HTML5 and Tailwind CSS. The design features custom abstract gradient images embedded directly into the markup using base64 encoding for quick loading and a premium aesthetic reminiscent of leading consumer brands.

## Structure
- `index.html` – Home page with hero section, features, and call-to-action section
- `about.html` – About page with story and mission
- `careers.html` – Careers page with sample openings
- `contact.html` – Contact page with a simple contact form

## Images
The site uses two custom abstract gradient backgrounds (hero and pastel) generated with AI tools and embedded via data URIs.

## Deployment
To deploy, host these static files on any static hosting platform (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify). For Vercel deployment:

1. Initialize a Git repository in the project root and commit the files.
2. Push to a GitHub repository.
3. Import the repository into Vercel and follow the prompts. Vercel will detect the static site and deploy automatically.
4. Optional: Add your custom domain in the Vercel dashboard and update DNS records accordingly.
